# Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning with MADDPG
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using the PettingZoo library. PettingZoo is designed similarly to OpenAI Gym but specifically for multi-agent environments, enabling research and experimentation with multiple interacting agents.
# Environment: simple_spread
* Description:
    The simple_spread environment consists of multiple agents that must navigate to reduce the distance to fixed targets in the environment.
    The team reward increases when all agents successfully cover their targets, encouraging cooperative behavior.

* Key Features:

    Multiple agents (e.g., N=2)

    Continuous action spaces

    Partially observable states for each agent

    Cooperative reward structure based on distance to goals
